An elite, high-performance personal portfolio website built to showcase full-stack software engineering projects, system architectures, and AI/ML data science experiments. 

This project features **zero external dependencies** or bloated libraries, relying entirely on advanced Vanilla CSS and JavaScript to achieve complex 3D DOM physics, custom cursors, and immersive rendering.

## 🚀 Key Features & UI/UX Highlights

This portfolio steps away from standard web templates to utilize modern, Awards-winning design patterns and high-end interactive physics:

* **Immersive Vertical Project Carousel:** A custom-engineered, full-screen project slider with crossfading background images, dynamic data injection, and continuous CSS scaling effects.
* **3D Mouse-Tracking Physics:** The "About Me" glassmorphism card calculates mouse positioning via JavaScript to apply a dynamic 10-degree `rotateX` and `rotateY` tilt effect in 3D space.
* **Advanced Typography Animations:** Features liquid-fill gradient text and scroll-scrubbing Intersection Observers.
* **Magnetic Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links use mathematical offsets to physically "pull" toward the user's cursor.
* **Flawless Infinite Marquee:** A mathematically calculated, zero-gap continuous scrolling tech-stack track using a dual-group overflow method.
* **Custom Cursor Engine:** A dual-element trailing cursor that dynamically expands when hovering over clickable DOM elements.
* **Dark / Light Mode Toggle:** Seamless CSS variable switching with `localStorage` persistence.
* **Serverless Contact Form:** Fully integrated with the Web3Forms API to handle form submissions directly to email without a backend database.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

Because this project uses vanilla web technologies without a build step or package manager, running it locally is instantaneous.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/NimnaOfficial/portfolio.git](https://github.com/NimnaOfficial/portfolio.git)
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```
3. **Run the site:**
   Simply double-click <code>index.html</code> to open it in your browser, or use a tool like VS Code's Live Server extension for hot-reloading.

## 🔧 Configuration Guide

1. **Updating Projects (The Vertical Carousel)**
   The project section is driven by a JavaScript array. To add or update projects, locate the <code>projectDatabase</code> array in <code>script.js</code> and modify the objects:

   ```bash
   const projectDatabase = [
    {
        title: "Your Project Name",
        desc: "Detailed description of your software architecture.",
        tags: ["Java", "Python", "SQL"]
    }
   ];
   ```
2. **Updating the Contact Form**
   The contact form is configured to send submissions directly to <code>lochsand2022@gmail.com</code>. If you fork this repo, replace the hidden <code>access_key</code> input in <code>index.html</code> with your own key from Web3Forms:
